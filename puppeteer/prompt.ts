Following contains inputs and expected outputs for the browserNext function
Your outputJSON must obey the following constraints:
1. only write valid code
2. outputJSON must be derived from input ariaTreeJSON in same session block
3. Do not reuse info from other session blocks
4. Do not solve objectives yourself, only let ariaTreeJSON be source for outputJSON
5. When our outputJSON.params includes text, do not pass text that's already in the textbox as that will cause a loop.
